# Regular Tasks

Regular Tasks include how normal, non-emergency, operational duties are
handled—that is, how work is received, queued, distributed, processed, and
verified, plus how periodic tasks are scheduled and performed. All services have
some kind of normal, scheduled or unscheduled work that needs to be done. Often
web operations teams do not perform direct customer support but there are
inter-team requests, requests from stakeholders, and escalations from direct
customer support teams.

## Sample Assessment Questions

- What are the common and periodic operational tasks and duties?
- Is there a playbook for common operational duties?
- What is the SLA for regular requests?
- How is the need for new playbook entries identified? Who may write new
  entries? Edit existing ones?
- How are requests from users received and tracked?
- Is there a playbook for common user requests?
- How often are user requests not covered by the playbook?
- How do users engage us for support? (online and physical locations)
- How do users know how to engage us for support?
- How do users know what is supported and what isn’t?
- How do we respond to a request for support of the unsupported?
- What are the limits of regular support (hours of operation, remote or on-site)
  ? How do users know these limits?
- Are different size categories handled differently? How is size determined?
- If there is a corporate standard practice for this OR, what is it and how does
  this service comply with the practice?

## Level 1: Initial

- There is no playbook, or it is out of date and unused
- Results are inconsistent
- Different people do tasks differently
- Two users requesting the same thing usually get different results
- Processes are not documented
- The team can’t enumerate all the processes a team does (even at a high level)
- Requests get lost or stalled indefinitely
- The organization cannot predict how long common tasks will take to complete
- Operational problems, if reported, don’t get attention

## Level 2: Repeatable

- There is a finite list of which services are supported by the team
- Each end-to-end process has each step enumerated, with dependencies
- Each end-to-end process has each step’s process documented
- Different people do the tasks the same way
- There is some duplication of effort seen in the flow
- Some information needed by multiple tasks may be re-created by each step that
  needs it

## Level 3: Defined

- The team has an SLA defined for most requests, though it may not be adhered to
- Each step has a QA checklist to be completed before handing off to next step
- Teams learn of process changes by other teams ahead of time
- Information or processing needed by multiple steps is created once
- There is no (or minimal) duplication of effort
- The ability to turn up new capacity is a repeatable process

## Level 4: Managed

- The defined SLA is measured
- There are feedback mechanisms for all steps
- There is periodic (weekly?) review of defects and reworks
- Postmortems are published for all to see, with a draft report available within
  x hours, and a final report completed within y days
- There is periodic review of alerts by the affected team. There is periodic
  review of alerts by a cross-functional team
- Process change requests require data to measure the problem being fixed
- Dashboards report data in business terms (i.e., not just technical terms)
- Every “failover procedure” has a “date of last use” dashboard
- Capacity needs are predicted ahead of need

## Level 5: Optimizing

- After process changes are made, before/after data are compared to determine
  success
- Process changes are reverted if before/after data shows no improvement
- Process changes that have been acted on come from a variety of sources
- At least one process change has come from every step (in recent history)
- Cycle time enjoys month-over-month improvements
- Decisions are supported by modeling “what if” scenarios using extracted actual
  data
