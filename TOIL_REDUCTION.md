# Toil Reduction

Toil Reduction is the process by which we improve the use of people within our
system. When we reduce toil (i.e., exhausting physical labor), we create a more
sustainable working environment for operational staff. While reducing toil is
not a service per se, this OR can be used to assess the amount of toil and
determine whether practices are in place to limit the amount of toil.

## Sample Assessment Questions

- How many hours each week are spent on coding versus non-coding projects?
- What percent of time is spent on project work versus manual labor that could
  be automated?
- What percentage of time spent on manual labor should raise a red flag?
- What is the process for detecting that the percentage of manual labor has
  exceeded the red flag threshold?
- What is the process for raising a red flag? Whose responsibility is it?
- What happens after a red flag is raised? When is it lowered?
- How are projects for reducing toil identified? How are they prioritized?
- How is the effectiveness of those projects measured?
- If there is a corporate standard practice for this OR, what is it and how does
  this service comply with the practice?

## Level 1: Initial

- Toil is not measured and grows until no project work, or almost no project
  work, can be accomplished
- There is no process for raising a red flag
- Some individuals recognize when toil is becoming a problem and look for
  solutions, but others are unaware of the problem
- Individuals choose to work on the projects that are the most interesting to
  them, without looking at which projects will have the biggest impact

## Level 2: Repeatable

- The amount of time spent on toil versus on projects is measured
- The percentage of time spent on toil that constitutes a problem is defined and
  communicated
- The process for raising a red flag is documented and communicated
- Individuals track their own toil to project work ratio, and are individually
  responsible for raising a red flag
- Red flags may not always be raised when they should be.
- The process for identifying which projects will have the greatest impact on
  toil reduction is defined
- The method for prioritizing projects is documented

## Level 3: Defined

- The person responsible for tracking toil and raising a red flag is identified
- The people involved in identifying and prioritizing toil-reduction projects
  are known
- Both a red flag Level and target Level of toil are defined. The red flag is
  lowered when toil reaches the target Level
- During the red flag period, the team works on only the highest-impact
  toil-reduction projects
- During the red flag period, the team has management support for putting other
  projects on hold until toil is reduced to a target Level
- After each step in a project, statistics on toil are closely monitored,
  providing feedback on any positive or negative changes

## Level 4: Managed

- Project time versus toil is tracked on a dashboard, and the amount of time
  spent on each individual project or manual task is also tracked
- Red flags are raised automatically, and the dashboard gives an overview of
  where the problems lie
- The time-tracking data is monitored for trends that give an early alert for
  teams that are showing an increase in toil in one or more areas
- KPIs are defined and tracked to keep toil within the desired range and
  minimize the red flag periods

## Level 5: Optimizing

- The target and red flag Levels are adjusted and the results are monitored to
  the effect on overall flow, performance, and innovation
- Changes to the main project prioritization process are introduced and
  evaluated for positive or negative impact, including the impact on toil
- Changes to the red flag toil-reduction task prioritization process are
  introduced and evaluated
